## CMS Integration

Sanity CMS is integrated with the Next.js application to provide dynamic content management. The interaction is structured as follows:

1. **Data Management in Sanity:** All product, category, and order data are managed in Sanity's content studio.
2. **Data Fetching:** Next.js uses GROQ queries to fetch structured content via Sanity's API.
3. **Server-side Rendering (SSR):** Dynamic pages like product details and order tracking utilize SSR for fast, up-to-date content.
4. **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Static pages like the homepage and shop categories are pre-rendered at build time.
5. **Real-time Updates:** Sanity webhooks enable instant updates when content changes.
